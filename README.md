Fork this repro and run `npm i` / `yarn` / `bun install` then run the start command.

### The task

### The rules

- You should be able to 'request dev mode' in figma, but if not, best-guess px values are fine.
- Please don't spend more than an 60 minutes.
- Don't use external tooling / libraries / packages

Send us a link to the fork when you are done

Good luck
